## Choosing the Right Platform

| Platform | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| **Netlify** | Beginners | Easiest setup, great docs | Bandwidth limits on free tier |
| **Vercel** | Performance | Fast, auto-deploys, analytics | Slightly more complex |

- [ ] Contact form works
- [ ] Custom domain (if configured)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled

## Updating Your Site

### For Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare:
Simply push changes to your main branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push origin main
```

The platform will automatically rebuild and redeploy.

### For GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### For Firebase:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails
- Check Node.js version (use v16+)
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`
- Check build logs for specific errors

### Pages don't load (404 errors)
- Verify build output directory is set to `dist`
- Check router configuration (ensure using `createWebHistory`)
- For GitHub Pages, check base URL in vite.config.js

### Images not loading
- Ensure images are in `public/` directory
- Check image paths (should be absolute: `/images/photo.jpg`)
- Verify image files were committed to git

### Forms not working
- For Netlify: Use Netlify Forms feature
- For others: Need to integrate with form service (Formspree, etc.)
